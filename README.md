# 3D Perspective Scroll

A simple web project demonstrating a 3D perspective scroll effect, featuring "The Pokemon Master's Journey" text. This effect is achieved using CSS 3D transforms and a small bit of JavaScript to handle the scroll progress.

## Features

- **3D Perspective:** Uses CSS `perspective` and `rotateX` to create a depth effect.
- **Dynamic Scrolling:** JavaScript calculates the scroll percentage to move the text upward as the user scrolls.
- **Gradient Text:** Animated/Stunning gradient text effect using `background-clip: text`.
- **Responsive-ish Design:** Centered container with fixed dimensions for the scroll area.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (3D Transforms, Flexbox/Positioning, Gradients)
- **JavaScript** (Scroll Event Listener)
- **Google Fonts** (Bricolage Grotesque)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open [index.html](index.html) in any modern web browser.
3. Scroll down to see the 3D text effect in action.

## Content
